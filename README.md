## 📌 Note on Checkboxes

If you view this file directly on GitHub, checkbox columns will show as **TRUE/FALSE** text.  
This happens because GitHub’s preview does not render interactive elements like Google Sheets checkboxes.

### ✅ Use the Interactive Google Sheets Version
This template will create a **personal editable copy** in your own Google Sheets account.  
All checkboxes, formatting, and formulas are preserved.

<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xqk1eQvG_oXtJ5ieQLGirnv9Bh6QHVfT/copy">
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20in-Google%20Sheets-34A853?style=for-the-badge&logo=google-sheets&logoColor=white" alt="Open in Google Sheets">
</a>

**How to use:**
1. Click the green button above.
2. Google Sheets will prompt you with *"Would you like to make a copy?"* — click **Make a copy**.
3. Your copy is now fully editable and saved in your Google Drive.
4. You can rename it and start entering your own bills and expenses.


### 💡 For Excel Users
1. **Download** the `.xlsx` file from this repository.
2. Open in Excel — checkboxes will appear as TRUE/FALSE text (normal).
3. To add native Excel checkboxes:
   - Go to the **Developer** tab  
     *(If hidden: File → Options → Customize Ribbon → check **Developer**.)*
   - In **Controls**, click **Insert** → **Form Controls** → **Checkbox**.
   - Draw the checkbox in the desired cell.
   - Right-click the checkbox → **Format Control…** → **Cell link** → select the TRUE/FALSE cell you want it to control (e.g., `D3`).
   - Copy/paste that checkbox down the column to reuse the linkage pattern (adjust cell links as needed).

> ℹ️ Tip: Keep the TRUE/FALSE cells (linked cells) hidden or off to the side and show a companion display column with a formula like `=IF(D3, "✅ Paid", "—")` so GitHub’s preview still looks clean.

## Tips
- You can create **named ranges** in Google Sheets to make formulas future-proof
- To avoid breaking formulas, insert instruction rows **outside** the main data tables
- Customize categories and colors to fit your budgeting style
