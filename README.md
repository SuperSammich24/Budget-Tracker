## üìå Note on Checkboxes

If you view this file directly on GitHub, checkbox columns will show as **TRUE/FALSE** text.  
This happens because GitHub‚Äôs preview does not render interactive elements like Google Sheets checkboxes.

### ‚úÖ Use the Interactive Google Sheets Version
This template will create a **personal editable copy** in your own Google Sheets account.  
All checkboxes, formatting, and formulas are preserved.

### üîó Direct Copy Link

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MX4Iuvjrk2uhIRapVr5MSTLsDdvkyJdPRCBPZd1ETiM/edit?usp=sharing

**How to use:**
1. Click the green button above.
2. Google Sheets will prompt you with *"Would you like to make a copy?"* ‚Äî click **Make a copy**.
3. Your copy is now fully editable and saved in your Google Drive.
4. You can rename it and start entering your own bills and expenses.


### üí° For Excel Users
1. **Download** the `.xlsx` file from this repository.
2. Open in Excel ‚Äî checkboxes will appear as TRUE/FALSE text (normal).
3. To add native Excel checkboxes:
   - Go to the **Developer** tab  
     *(If hidden: File ‚Üí Options ‚Üí Customize Ribbon ‚Üí check **Developer**.)*
   - In **Controls**, click **Insert** ‚Üí **Form Controls** ‚Üí **Checkbox**.
   - Draw the checkbox in the desired cell.
   - Right-click the checkbox ‚Üí **Format Control‚Ä¶** ‚Üí **Cell link** ‚Üí select the TRUE/FALSE cell you want it to control (e.g., `D3`).
   - Copy/paste that checkbox down the column to reuse the linkage pattern (adjust cell links as needed).

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Tip: Keep the TRUE/FALSE cells (linked cells) hidden or off to the side and show a companion display column with a formula like `=IF(D3, "‚úÖ Paid", "‚Äî")` so GitHub‚Äôs preview still looks clean.
